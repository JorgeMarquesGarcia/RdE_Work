This part of the project is divided into two main programs:

- 🏋️ [The Data acquisition code](./Data_acquisition/)  The code devolped in Arduino IDE to make the data acquisition using the integrated accelorometer & send data through low energy blueetoth.
    
- 🧠 [The Edge Impulse code](./Impulse/) The code developed in Edge impulse to achieve the auto-detection of movement & count repetitions.
